How to make it open up a spoole file scheme and not a member\r\n    1. openEditable command runs `QSysFs.getUriFromPath()`\r\n        1. this function only analyzes the path that's passed in as the search view does not have the scheme for the path associated to it. \r\n        1. Is the scheme something that can be added in the load of the \"hit\" items in the searchView?  \r\n&nbsp;\r\n1. spooled file search cannot handle large list of spooled files to search  \r\n    1. Current pattern is to use JSON_TABLE() to map list from string to working data\r\n        1. However, when spooled file list is too big the statement size becomes too big\r\n        1. Moving to te GET_FROM_CLOB_FILE() causes commitment control to be active and reduces the performance so much that its not usable, IMO.\r\n    1. New patterns needed that reduce or eliminate the need to server objects if possbile.\r\n        1. Most realistic pattern I can see is to write spooled file list to a temp table in ILEDITOR library and read from that list.

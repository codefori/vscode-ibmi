# Contributing to Code for IBM i

We welcome all users to contribute. Whether it be to documentation, or code, we love it all. We use a typical PR system:

1. You fork & clone
2. Commit and push changes to your fork
3. Make a pull request (PR)

If you are making a pull request which fixes a bug, adds a feature or changes documentation, expect your PR to be reviewed. Be sure to read [Contributing to projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) on the GitHub documentation.

If you want to help but you're unsure what to work on, here are two easy places to start:

* Check out the 'good first issue' tag [in our issues](https://github.com/halcyon-tech/vscode-ibmi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
* See what improvements can be made to [our documentation](https://github.com/halcyon-tech/vscode-ibmi/tree/master/docs).

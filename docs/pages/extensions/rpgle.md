## Install

The extension can be [installed from the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.vscode-rpgle) and is also part of the [IBM i Development Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.ibm-i-development-pack).

RPGLE language tools also works in VS Code web.

## Usage

The extension has two main pieces of functionality:

* language tools: content assist, outline view, etc. Supports every version of ILE RPG (fixed, mixed and free-format)
* linter: configurable linter to check code quality. **Only supports total free-format** (`**FREE`).

The language tools are enabled by default, but the linter must be enabled in the VS Code settings. The linter is always enabled when being used by VS Code web.

## Creating lint configuration

You can create lint configuration for all types of file type. Use the 'Open RPGLE lint configuration' command from the command palette to automatically create and open the relative lint configuration from the RPGLE source you are working in.

### Relative lint config

* If you are developing in `LIB/QRPGLESRC/MYSOURCE.RPGLE`, then the linter config exists in `LIB/VSCODE/RPGLINT.JSON`. Each library has its own rules configuration file, binding it to all RPGLE sources in that library. 
* When developing in the IFS, linter rules config exist in `.vscode/rpglint.json` relative to the current working directory.
* When developing in a local workspace, linter rules exist in `.vscode/rpglint.json` relative to the workspace.

### Lint options

Below are some available lint configs. [See the `rpglint.json` schema for the most up to date rules](https://github.com/halcyon-tech/vscode-rpgle/blob/main/src/schemas/rpglint.json).

### How do I compile my source code?

1. Edit your library list in the 'USER LIBRARY LIST' browser. (Each connection has its own library list.)
2. Open the source you want to compile.
3. Use Ctrl+E or Cmd+E to compile your source.
4. If you have more than one compile option available to you for the type of source, select the appropriate one.
5. If you are using `*EVENTF`, the error listing should automatically load in the PROBLEMS tab.

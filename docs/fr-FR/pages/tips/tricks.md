### Running SQL statement

Install the [Db2 for IBM i extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.vscode-db2i) for this functionality.

It is also possible to run SQL statements right from the editor in an SQL file. You can either highlight the statement you want to run or move your anchor over the statement and use Ctrl+R/Cmd+R to execute the statement. **note: statements only run in SQL mode and does not inherit the library list**

SQL result sets appear in the 'IBM i: Results' panel.

Much like the SQL pre-processor, you can now run CL commands from an SQL scripts. As well as CL commands, you can also get your SQL result set back as `json` or `csv`.

```
-- result set as normal table
select * from sample.employee;

-- result set as JSON, will open in a new file
json: select * from sample.employee;

-- result set as CSV, will open in a new file
csv: select * from sample.employee;

-- run CL commands. output is directed to IBM i output channel
cl: dspffd sample/employee
```


### Search source files and IFS directories

Right click and click 'Search' on IFS directories and source files to search through the content of streamfiles and source members.

### Overtype

VS Code works in "insert" mode. This can be annoying when editing a fixed mode source, for example DDS. Fortunately there is an [Overtype extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DrMerfy.overtype) that allows you to toggle between insert and  overtype, and can also display the current mode in the status bar.

### Font Size

Font size in the editor is controlled by the VS Code setting *Editor: Font Size*.  However, with your cursor in an editor, you can also temporarily change the editor font size by holding Ctrl and using your mouse scroll bar.

Font size in the Menu, Side, Status and Activity bars can be changed using holding down Ctrl, then using  + or -. Such changes will hold from session to session. However, this will also change the size of the editor font and you may have to adjust it as above for this session.

Rule of thumb: Experiment.

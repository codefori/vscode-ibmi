Most of the setting have a self explanatory description. A few have notes below.

### Actions

Actions can be edited in settings.json, but also more easily by clicking **Actions** in the status bar. See *Actions*, above.

### Connections

Connections can be edited in settings.json, but you'd typically add additional connections as in *Connect First Time*, above.

### Connection Settings

These are the various setting relating to the items in the browsers, e.g., the list of source files in the OBJECT BROWSER. While these can be edited in settings.json, most can be more easily maintained by clicking or right clicking on an item in the browser.

### Log Compile Output

When enabled, spool files will be logged from the command execution.
These spool files can be found under the **OUTPUT** tab (View->Output, or Ctrl + Shift + U). Select **IBM i Output** in the drop down on the right.

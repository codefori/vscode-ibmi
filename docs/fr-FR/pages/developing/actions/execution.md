There are four varieties of Actions:

- if type is `file` and 'deploy first' is enabled, deploy the workspace, then:
- execute immediately,
- or they can be displayed for modification,
- or they can be prompted through the user interface.

### Execute Immediately

If we have a "**Call program**" command with a "Command to run" string like this:

`CALL &LIBRARY/&NAME`  

It will execute immediatly it is selected.

### Display for modification

If the "Command to run" string has a leading "**?**", e.g., like this:

`?CALL &LIBRARY/&NAME`  

It is displayed and you can edit it as needed.

For example, you might want to add **PARM('Douglas' 'Adams')** to the end.

### Prompted

Rather than using the "?", you can have the Action prompt for values.
The "Command to run" string can have embedded prompt string(s) to invoke prompting.

A "prompt string" has the format ``${NAME|LABEL|[DEFAULTVALUE]}`` where:

- NAME is an arbitrary name for the prompt field, but must be unique for this action.
- LABEL is the text to describe the prompt field.
- [DEFAULTVALUE] is an **optional** value to pre-populate the prompt field.

#### *Example 1*

Suppose we have a "**Call program, prompt for parms**" action with the "Command to run" defined like this:

``CALL &LIBRARY/&NAME PARM('${AAA|First name|Your name}' '${xyz|Last Name}')``

If we run the action it prompts like this:

If we complete the screen like this:

![Completed Prompted Action](../../../assets/actions_exec_04.png)

and click **Execute** a command like this is executed;

``CALL LENNONS1/ATEST PARM('Douglas' 'Adams')``

#### *Example 2*

You can also use variables in the prompt string. If an action is defined like this:

``CALL &LIBRARY/&NAME PARM('${AAA|Library|&CURLIB}' '${xyz|Report Name}')``

&CURLIB will be substituted and the prompt will look like this when executed:

#### *Example 3*

Here's a more complex example of a "**Run CRTBNDRPG (inputs)**" action.
The 'Command to run" string is defined like this:

``CRTBNDRPG PGM(${buildlib|Build library|&BUILDLIB}/${objectname|Object Name|&NAME}) SRCSTMF('${sourcePath|Source path|&FULLPATH}') OPTION(*EVENTF) DBGVIEW(*SOURCE) TGTRLS(*CURRENT)``

When executed, it prompts like this:
